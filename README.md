HOW NOT TO CALCULATE THE TAX IN  JAVA LANGUAGE
Using the double types, implement the following:
Suppose a product costs 9.99 net, calculate its gross value (we assume VAT of 23%). 
Then multiply it by 10,000 (i.e., we sold 10,000 pcs of this product), and calculate this value excluding VAT.
-------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
Implement the above actions using the Big Decimal class. Print on the console all computed values, compare their values. What conclusions do you have?
