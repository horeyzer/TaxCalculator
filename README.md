HOW NOT TO CALCULATE THE TAX IN  JAVA LANGUAGE
Using the double types, implement the following:
Suppose a product costs 9.99 net, calculate its gross value (we assume VAT of 23%). 
Then multiply it by 10,000 (i.e., we sold 10,000 pcs of this product), and calculate this value excluding VAT.

Implement the above actions using the Big Decimal class. Print on the console all computed values, compare their values. What conclusions do you have?
